 * Adapted code from https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/11967
 * Calculates oriented bounding box size
 * Essentially it negates flex root rotation to provide proper number
 * E.g. if root flex group rotatet 45 degress, a cube box of size 1 will report sizes of sqrt(2)
 * but it should still be 1
 *
 * NB: This doesn't work when object itself is rotated (well, for now)
