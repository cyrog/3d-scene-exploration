# three.js 3D scene exploration

This project demonstrates the creation of a dynamic 3D scene with interactive sky settings and animated objects using Three.js and Threlte. The animation is controlled by the wheel event.

## Features
- **3D Scene**: A rotating group of spheres with smooth animation.
- **Sky Simulation**: Dynamic sky transition between sunset and night based on key inputs.
- **Interactive Controls**: The scene responds to the "Up Arrow" key, updating the sky's appearance and rotating objects.
- **Smooth Animation**: Time-based animations are used for smooth transitions and effects.

## Technologies Used

    Three.js: JavaScript 3D library for rendering the 3D scene and animations.
    Threlte: A Svelte wrapper for Three.js, providing an easier integration with Svelte.
    Svelte: A modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
